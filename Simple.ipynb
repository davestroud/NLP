SpaceX was founded in 2002 byElon Muskwith the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable thecolonization of Mars. SpaceX manufactures theFalcon 9andFalcon Heavylaunch vehicles,several rocket engines,Dragoncargo and crew spacecraft andStarlinkcommunications satellites.SpaceX's achievements include the first privately fundedliquid-propellant rocketto reach orbit (Falcon 1in 2008), the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft (Dragonin 2010), the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station (Dragon in 2012), the firstvertical take-off and vertical propulsive landingfor an orbital rocket (Falcon 9in 2015), the first reuse of an orbital rocket (Falcon 9 in 2017), and the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to theInternational Space Station(SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2in 2020). SpaceX has flown and reflown the Falcon 9 series of rocketsover one hundred times.SpaceX is developing a satellite megaconstellation namedStarlinkto provide commercial internet service. In January 2020 the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation in the world. SpaceX is also developingStarship, a privately funded,fully reusable,super heavy-lift launch systemforinterplanetary spaceflight. Starship is intended to become the primary SpaceX orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon fleet. Starship will be fully reusable and will have the highest payload capacity of any orbital rocket ever on its debut, scheduled for the early 2020s.Contents1History1.12001–2004: Founding1.22005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches1.32010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts1.42013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth1.52015–2017: Reusability milestones1.62017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider1.72019–present: Starship, Starlink, and first crewed launches1.8Summary of achievements2Hardware2.1Launch vehicles2.2Rocket engines2.3Dragon spacecraft2.4Autonomous spaceport drone ships2.5Starship2.6Starlink2.6.1Controversies2.7Other projects3Facilities3.1Headquarters, manufacturing, and refurbishment facilities3.2Development and test facilities3.3Launch facilities3.3.1Cape Canaveral Space Force Station3.3.2Vandenberg Air Force Base3.3.3Kennedy Space Center3.3.4Boca Chica, Texas3.4Satellite manufacturing facility4Contracts4.1NASA4.1.1COTS4.1.2Commercial cargo4.1.3Commercial crew4.2National defense4.3Space tourism5Launch market competition and pricing pressure6Board of directors7See also8References9Further reading10External linksHistory[edit]Main article:History of SpaceXSee also:List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches2001–2004: Founding[edit]In 2001,Elon MuskconceptualizedMars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimentalgreenhouseand growplantson Mars.[citation needed]He announced that the project would be \"the farthest that life's ever traveled\" in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration and increase thebudget of NASA.[5][6][7]Musk tried to purchase cheap rockets fromRussiabut returned empty-handed after failing to find rockets for an affordable price.[8][9]On the flight home Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[9]By applyingvertical integration,[8]using cheapcommercial off-the-shelfcomponents when possible,[9]and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.[9]In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his new space company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineerTom Mueller(later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion), and invited him to become his business partner. Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.[10]SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse inEl Segundo, California. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[11]Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access tospace, ultimately by a factor of ten.[12]The first successful Falcon 1 launch in September 20082005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches[edit]Main article:Falcon 1SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with private funding.[13][14]The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbitsmall-lift launch vehicle. \n",
      "The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximatelyUS$90 million.[15]In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program which would later become theDragon spacecraft.[16]In 2006, NASA announced that the company was one of two selected to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the ISS under the COTS program.[17]The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by theUnited States Department of Defenseunder a program that evaluates new US launch vehicles suitable for use byDARPA.[14][18][19]The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures. The first successful launch was achieved on 28 September 2008. The Falcon 1 was retired after its second successful, and fifth total, launch in July 2009, which allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[20]2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts[edit]Play mediaVideo of the first launch of Falcon 9Dragon capsule after recovery from ocean landing in December 2010, following the first operational Dragon missionCOTS-1SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5.[21]SpaceX instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated byNASA, which committed to purchase several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) program in 2006.[22]The overall contract award was US$278 million to provide development funding for theDragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[22]As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with theDragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.\n",
      "The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboardCOTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned toEarthafter two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.[23]By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.[24]In April 2011, as part of its second-roundCommercial Crew Development(CCDev) program, NASA issued a US$75 million contract for SpaceX to develop an integratedlaunch escape systemfor Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[25]In August 2012 NASA awarded SpaceX a firm, fixed-priceSpace Act Agreement(SAA) with the objective of producing a detailed design of the entire crew transportation system. This contract includes numerous key technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions following system certification.[26]In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of the company stock was owned by the founder Musk[27]and his 70 million shares were then estimated to be worth US$875 million onprivate markets,[28]valuing SpaceX at US$1.3 billion.[29]In May 2012, with theDragon C2+launch Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to theInternational Space Station.[30]After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to US$2.4 billion or US$20/share.[31][32]By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately US$1 billion over its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately US$200 million, with Musk investing approximately US$100 million and other investors having put in about US$100 million.[33]SpaceX's active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.[34]TheFalcon 9 prototypesperformed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL).\n",
      "High-velocity, high-altitude tests of theboosteratmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[34]2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth[edit]Launch of Falcon 9 carrying ORBCOMM OG2-M1, July 2014Employees with theDragon capsuleat SpaceX HQ inHawthorne, California, February 2015SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. \n",
      "In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[35]That year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additionalsubsidiesto face the competition from SpaceX.[36][37]Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade was dominated by the large U.S. launch providerUnited Launch Alliance(ULA).[38]The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over US$400 million over the years.[39]In January 2015, SpaceX raised US$1 billion in funding fromGoogleandFidelity, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately US$12 billion.[40]The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, calledStarlink, to provide global broadband internet service. The following June, the company asked the federal government for permission to begin testing for the project, aiming to build a constellation of 4,425 satellites.[41]The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission,CRS-7exploded two minutes into the flight.[42]The problem was traced to a failed 2-foot-long steel strut that held aheliumpressure vessel, which broke free due to the force ofacceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressure propellant tank, causing the failure.[43]2015–2017: Reusability milestones[edit]Long-exposure of launch (left) and landing (right) during theFalcon 9 flight 20, the first successful return and vertical landing of an orbital rocket.Falcon 9 first stage on anautonomous spaceport drone ship(ASDS) barge after the first successful landing at sea,SpaceX CRS-8mission.SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 withFalcon 9 Flight 20.[44]In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS)Of Course I Still Love Youin the Atlantic Ocean.[45]By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.[46]In early September 2016, a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launchstatic fire test.[47]The payload, theAmos-6communications satellite valued at US$200 million, was destroyed.[48]The explosion was caused by theliquid oxygenthat is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited withcarbon compositehelium vessels.[49]Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[50]On 30 March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for theSES-10satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[51]The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[52]2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider[edit]In July 2017, the Company raised US$350 million for a valuation of US$21 billion.[53]In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[54]By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about US$12 billion in contract revenue.[55]The contracts included both commercial andgovernment(NASA/DOD) customers.[56]This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[57]In 2017, SpaceX formed asubsidiary,The Boring Company,[58]and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, utilizing a small number of SpaceX employees,[59]which was completed in May 2018,[60]and opened to the public in December 2018.[61]During 2018, The Boring Company wasspun outinto a separatecorporate entitywith 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.[61]2019–present: Starship, Starlink, and first crewed launches[edit]On 11 January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce in order to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects.[62]Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the newSpaceX South Texas launch sitelater that year.\n",
      "In May 2019 SpaceX also launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning the deployment of what would become the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[63]SpaceX raised a total of US$1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds in 2019.[64]By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to US$33.3 billion[65]and reached US$36 billion by March 2020.[66]On 30 May 2020, SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug HurleyandBob Behnken) into orbit on aCrew Dragonspacecraft duringCrew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to theInternational Space Stationand marking the first crewed launch from American soil in 9 years.[67][68]The mission launched fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A(LC-39A) of theKennedy Space CenterinFlorida.[69]On 19 August 2020, after a US$1.9 billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX's valuation increased to US$46 billion.[70][71][72]In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additionalUS$1.61 billionin an equity round from 99 investors[73]at a per share value of approximately $420,[72]raising the company valuation to approximatelyUS$74 billion.It has raised a total of more thanUS$6 billionin equity financing to date. The capital-intensive phase in recent years has been principally to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[73]Summary of achievements[edit]Major achievements of SpaceX are in the reuse of orbital-class launch vehicles and cost reduction in the space launch industry. Most notable of these being the continued landings and relaunches of the first stage of Falcon 9 following a multi-yearprogram to develop the reusable technology. As of May 2021, SpaceX has used two separate first-stage boosters,B1049andB1051, nine and ten times respectively.[74]Elon Musk has gone on to say they will continue to push the fleet leader,B1051, past the original goal of ten flights.[75]SpaceX is a private space company with most of its achievements the result of self-funded development efforts, not developed by traditionalcost-plus contractingof the US government.  As a result, many of its achievements are also considered as firsts by a private company.List of achievements by SpaceXDateAchievementFlight28 September 2008First privately funded fully liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.[76]Falcon 1 flight 414 July 2009First privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to put a commercial satellite in orbit.RazakSATonFalcon 1 flight 59 December 2010First private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.SpaceX DragononSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 125 May 2012First private company to send a spacecraft to theInternational Space Station(ISS).[77]Dragon C2+22 December 2015First landing of an orbital-class rocket's first stage on land.Falcon 9B1019onOrbcomm OG2 M28 April 2016First landing of an orbital-class rocket's first stage on an ocean platform.Falcon 9B1021onSpaceX CRS-830 March 2017First reuse, reflight and (second) landing of an orbital first stage.[51]Falcon 9B1021onSES-1030 March 2017First controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing.[78]SES-103 June 2017First re-flight of a commercial cargo spacecraft.[79]Dragon C106onSpaceX CRS-116 February 2018First private spacecraft launched intoheliocentric orbit.Elon Musk's Tesla RoadsteronFalcon Heavy test flight2 March 2019First private company to send a human-rated spacecraft to orbit.Crew Dragon Demo-13 March 2019First private company to autonomously dock a spacecraft to theInternational Space Station(ISS).25 July 2019First flight of afull-flow staged combustion cycle engine(Raptor).[80]Starhopper11 November 2019First reuse and reflight of payload fairing.

The small-liftFalcon 1was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-liftFalcon 9and the heavy-liftFalcon Heavyare both operational. \n",
      "TheFalcon 1was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms intolow Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which 2 successfully.[84]It functioned as an early test-bed for developing concepts and components for the larger Falcon 9.[84]The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.[76]Falcon 9is anmedium-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265 lb) to orbit, competing with theDelta IVand theAtlas Vrockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nineMerlinengines in its first stage. TheFalcon 9 v1.0rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 4 June 2010. Its third flight,COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 22 May 2012, and was the firstcommercialspacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).[30]The vehicle was upgraded toFalcon 9 v1.1in 2013,Falcon 9 Full Thrustin 2015, and finally toFalcon 9 Block 5in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retropropulsively land, be recovered, and reflown.TheFalcon Heavyis aheavy-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 63,800 kg (140,700 lb) toLow Earth orbit(LEO) or 26,700 kg (58,900 lb) togeosynchronous transfer orbit(GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first stage cores with a total of 27Merlin 1Dengines.[85][86]The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on 6 February 2018, launching Musk's personalTesla Roadsterintoheliocentric orbit[87]Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for theNational Security Space Launch(NSSL).\n",
      "As of March 2021[update], the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 120 times, resulting in 118 full mission successes, one partial success,one in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienceda pre-flight failureprior to a static fire test in 2016.Rocket engines[edit]Main article:SpaceX rocket enginesTheMerlin 1Dengine undergoes a test at SpaceX's Rocket Development and Test Facility inMcGregor, Texas.Since the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed severalrocket engines—Merlin,Kestrel, andRaptorfor use inlaunch vehicles,Dracofor thereaction control systemof the Dragon series of spacecraft, andSuperDracofor abort capability inCrew Dragon.Merlin is a family of rocket engines that usesliquid oxygen(LOX) andRP-1propellants in agas-generator power cycle. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1's first stage, and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. The Merlin engine uses apintleinjector that provides deep-throttle capability used during Falcon 9 landings. Propellants are fed via a single shaft, dual impellerturbopump.Kestrel is a LOX/RP-1pressure-fedrocket engine and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket's second stage main engine. It is built around the same pintle architecture as SpaceX's Merlin engine but does not have aturbopump, and isfed only by tank pressure. The engine isablatively cooledin the chamber and throat, and isradiatively cooledon the exhaust nozzle. The Kestrel's nozzle is fabricated from a high strengthniobiumalloy.Draco is ahypergolicliquid-propellant rocket engine that utilizesmonomethyl hydrazinefuelandnitrogen tetroxideoxidizer. Each Draco thruster generates 400 N (90 lbf) of thrust.[88]They are used on thereaction control systemof theDragonandDragon 2spacecraft.[89]SuperDracois a hypergolic liquid-propellant rocket engine that, like Draco, usesmonomethyl hydrazineandnitrogen tetroxidepropellants. Eight SuperDraco engines providelaunch escape capabilityfor crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario. Each SuperDraco engine produces 73 kN (16,000 lbf) of thrust. Initial concepts for the Crew Dragon spacecraft used the SuperDraco engines to perform a retropropulsive landing on land, however, these were scrapped in 2017 when it was decided to perform a traditional parachute descent andsplashdownat sea.[90]First test firing of a subscaleRaptordevelopment engine in September 2016 in McGregor, Texas.Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquidmethane-fueledfull-flow staged combustion cycleengines to power the first and second stages of the in-developmentStarshiplaunch system.[91]Development versions were test-fired in late 2016.[92]On 3 April 2019, SpaceX conducted a static fire test in Texas on itsStarhoppervehicle, which ignited the engine while the vehicle remained tethered to the ground.[93]In 2019, Raptor flew for the first time, powering theStarhoppervehicle to an altitude of 20 m (66 ft).[94]SpaceX continues to conduct further test flights of the Starship vehicle in 2020 and 2021.[95]Dragon spacecraft[edit]Main articles:SpaceX DragonandDragon 2The SpaceX'sCrew Dragonspacecraft, designed to deliver crew to and from the International Space Station as part of theCommercial Crew Developmentprogram.SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to theInternational Space Station. Thefirst version of Dragon, used only for cargo, was first launched in 2010. The currently operational second generation Dragon spacecraft, known asDragon 2, conductedits first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed bya crewed flightof Dragon 2 in 2020. Dragon 2 is capable of transporting a crew of up to seven (four in NASA configuration) tolow Earth orbit.On 7 December 2020 SpaceX flewthe cargo variant of Dragon 2to the Space Station for 100th successful Falcon 9 flight. This is the first launch for this redesigned cargo Dragon, and also the first mission for SpaceX's new series of CRS missions under a renewed contract with NASA.[96]On 27 March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL resupply spacecraft to carry pressurized and unpressurized cargo, experiments and other supplies to NASA's plannedLunar Gatewayspace station under aGateway Logistics Services(GLS) contract.[97]NASA plans to use Dragon XL to transport sample collection materials, spacesuits and other supplies to be used on the Gateway and on the surface of theMoon. Dragon XL will launch on theFalcon Heavyand will transport more than 5,000 kg (11,000 lb) to the Gateway. Dragon XL will stay at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time, when research payloads inside and outside the cargo vessel could be operated remotely, even when crews are not present.[98][99]Autonomous spaceport drone ships[edit]Main articles:SpaceX reusable launch system development program,Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests, andAutonomous spaceport drone shipAnautonomous spaceport drone shipin position prior to Falcon 9 Flight 17 carrying CRS-6.SpaceX routinely returns thefirst stageof Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket flights and land to a predetermined landing site using only its own propulsion systems.[100]When propellent margins do not permit a return to launch site (RTLS), rockets return to floating landing platform in the ocean, calledautonomous spaceport drone ships(ASDS).[101]SpaceX also plans to introducefloating launch platforms. These are modified oil rigs to use in the 2020s to provide a sea launch option for their second-generation launch vehicle: the heavy-lift Starship system, consisting of the Super Heavy booster and Starship second stage.\n",
      "SpaceX has purchasedtwo deepwater oil rigsand are refitting them to support Starship launches.[102]Starship[edit]Main articles:SpaceX Mars transportation infrastructure,SpaceX Starship, andStarship development historySpaceX Starship SN8 prototype during a flight test, December 2020.SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known asStarship. \n",
      "The Starship system comprises a reusable first stage, called Super Heavy, and the reusable Starship second stage and space vehicle. The system is intended to supersede the company's existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s.[103][104]SpaceX initially envisioned a 12-meter-diameter ITS concept in 2016 which was solely aimed at Mars transit and other interplanetary uses. In 2017 SpaceX articulated a smaller 9-meter-diameter vehicle to replace all of SpaceX launch service provider capabilities — Earth-orbit, lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and potentially, even intercontinental passenger transport on Earth — but do so on a fully reusable set of vehicles with a markedly lower cost structure.[105]In 2018, the Starship system was redesigned to use stainless steel instead ofcarbon fiberconstruction, with the aims of improving performance while drastically decreasing cost. \n",

SpaceX won subsidies to bring service to customers in 35 U.S. states.[114]Controversies[edit]Signal pollution in a 333-second exposure image taken from the Blanco four-meter telescope at theCerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory.The planned large number ofStarlinksatellites been criticized by astronomers due to concerns overlight pollution,[115][116][117]with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.[118]In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness during operation.[119]The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers ofspace debriscollisionsresulting from placing thousands of satellites in orbit.[120][121]Other projects[edit]Main article:Hyperloop pod competitionIn June 2015 SpaceX announced that they would sponsor aHyperloopcompetition, and would build a 1.6 km (0.99 mi) longsubscaletest track near SpaceX's headquarters for the competitive events.[122][123]The company has held annual competitions since 2017.[124][125]In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of aCOVID-19antibody-testing program in 2020. As such 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood-samples resulting in apeer-reviewedscientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus.[126][127]Facilities[edit]The headquarters of the company, located inHawthorne, California.SpaceX isheadquarteredin Hawthorne, California, which also serves as its primary manufacturing plant. The company operates a research and major operation inRedmond, Washington, owns a test site in Texas and operates three launch sites, with another under development. SpaceX also operates regional offices in Texas, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.[56]SpaceX was incorporated in the state ofDelaware.[128]Headquarters, manufacturing, and refurbishment facilities[edit]Falcon 9 v1.1rocket cores under construction at the Hawthorne facility, November 2014.SpaceX Headquarters is located in theLos Angelessuburb ofHawthorne, California. The large three-story facility, originally built byNorthrop Corporationto buildBoeing 747fuselages,[129]houses SpaceX's office space, mission control, and, Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities.[130]The area has one of the largest concentrations of aerospace headquarters, facilities, and/or subsidiaries in the U.S., includingBoeing/McDonnell Douglasmain satellite building campuses,Aerospace Corp.,Raytheon, NASA'sJet Propulsion Laboratory,United States Space Force'sSpace and Missile Systems CenteratLos Angeles Air Force Base,Lockheed Martin,BAE Systems,Northrop Grumman, andAECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates.[129]SpaceX utilizes a high degree ofvertical integrationin the production of its rockets and rocket engines.[8]SpaceX builds itsrocket engines,rocket stages,spacecraft, principalavionicsand allsoftwarein-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the aerospace industry. Nevertheless, SpaceX still has over 3,000 suppliers, with some 1,100 of those delivering to SpaceX nearly weekly.[131]Development and test facilities[edit]Main article:SpaceX Rocket Development and Test FacilitySpaceX McGregor engine test bunker, September 2012SpaceX operates its first Rocket Development and Test Facility inMcGregor, Texas. All SpaceX rocket engines are tested onrocket test stands, and low-altitudeVTVLflight testing of the Falcon 9Grasshopperv1.0 andF9R Dev1test vehicles in 2013–2014 were carried out at McGregor. \n",
      "Testing of the much larger Starship prototypes is conducted in theSpaceX South Texas launch sitenearBrownsville, Texas.[130]The company purchased the McGregor facilities fromBeal Aerospace, where it refitted the largest test stand forFalcon 9engine testing. SpaceX has made a number of improvements to the facility since purchase and has also extended the acreage by purchasing several pieces of adjacent farmland. The company built a half-acre concrete launch facility in 2012 to support the Grasshopper test flight program.[132]As of October 2012[update], the McGregor facility had seven test stands that are operated \"18 hours a day, six days a week\"[133]and is building more test stands because production is ramping up and the company has a large manifest in the next several years.\n",
      "In addition to routine testing, Dragon capsules (following recovery after an orbital mission), are shipped to McGregor for de-fueling, cleanup, and refurbishment for reuse in future missions.Launch facilities[edit]Main article:SpaceX launch facilitiesSpaceX west coast launch facility atVandenberg Air Force Base, during the launch ofCASSIOPE, September 2013.SpaceX currently operates threeorbitallaunch sites, atCape Canaveral Space Force Station,Vandenberg Air Force Base, andKennedy Space Center, and is under construction on a fourth inBrownsville, Texas. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.[134]The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral enables orbits of medium inclination (28.5–51.6°).[135]Before it was retired, allFalcon 1launches took place at theRonald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test SiteonOmelek Island.Cape Canaveral Space Force Station[edit]In April 2007 the USAF approved the use ofCape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40(SLC-40) by SpaceX.[136]The site has been used from 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. SLC-40 is not capable of supporting Falcon Heavy launches. As part of SpaceX's booster reusability program, the formerLaunch Complex 13at Cape Canaveral, now renamedLanding Zone 1, has since 2015 been designated for use for Falcon 9first-stage booster landings.[137]Falcon 9 Flight 20landing onLanding Zone 1in December 2015Vandenberg Air Force Base[edit]Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4(SLC-4E) leased in 2011, is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy,[138]but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W has been converted to Landing Zone 4 since 2015, where SpaceX has successfully landed three Falcon 9 first-stage boosters, the first in October 2018.[139]Kennedy Space Center[edit]On 14 April 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease forLaunch Complex 39A.[140]The pad was subsequently modified to supportFalcon 9andFalcon Heavylaunches. SpaceX launched itsfirst crewed missionto the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on 30 May 2020.[141]Boca Chica, Texas[edit]The Starship \"high bay\" assembly building under construction at Boca Chica in August 2020Main article:SpaceX South Texas launch siteSpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from a facility at Boca Chica, Texas, with future plans to conduct orbital Starship flights in 2021.[142]SpaceX first publicly announced plans for a launch facility nearBrownsville, Texasin August 2014.[143][144]TheFederal Aviation Administration(FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.[145]SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,[146]with the firstsuborbitallaunches from the facility in 2019.[130]Satellite manufacturing facility[edit]Further information:StarlinkIn January 2015 SpaceX announced it would be entering the satellite production business and global satellite internet business. The first satellite facility is a 30,000 sq ft (2,800 m2) office building located inRedmond, Washington. As of January 2017, a second facility in Redmond was acquired with 40,625 sq ft (3,774.2 m2) and has become a research and development laboratory for the satellites.[147]In July 2016, SpaceX acquired an additional 8,000 sq ft (740 m2) creative space inIrvine, California(Orange County) to focus on satellite communications.[148][149]Contracts[edit]Further information on SpaceX launches:Falcon 1 § Launch manifest,List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches, andList of Starship flightsSpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts fromNASAfor theInternational Space Station(ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified forU.S. militarylaunches ofEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately 30 missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represents over US$12 billion under contract.[56]NASA[edit]COTS[edit]Main article:Commercial Orbital Transportation ServicesThe COTS 2 Dragon is berthed to theInternational Space Station(ISS) byCanadarm2.In 2006 NASA announced that SpaceX had won a NASACommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to theInternational Space Station(ISS), with a possible contract option for crew transport.[150]Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX US$396 million to develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX self-invested more than US$500 million to develop the Falcon 9 launch vehicle.[151]TheseSpace Act Agreementshave been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development ~4–10 times cheaper than if produced by NASA alone.[152]In December 2010 the launch of theSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft.[153]Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS duringSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2in May 2012, a first for a private spacecraft.[154]Commercial cargo[edit]Main articles:Commercial Resupply ServicesandGateway Logistics ServicesCommercial Resupply Services(CRS) are a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded US$1.6 billion to SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.[155]SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed and remained on station for 20 days, beforere-entering the atmosphereand splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[156]CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, for a total of 15 cargo transport.[157][155]After further extensions late in 2015, SpaceX is currently scheduled to fly a total of 20 resupply missions.[158]A second phase of contracts, known asCRS-2, were awarded in January 2016 for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024.In March 2020 NASA contracted SpaceX to develop theDragon XLspacecraft to send supplies to theLunar Gatewayspace station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[159]Commercial crew[edit]Main article:Commercial Crew DevelopmentCrew Dragon undergoing testing prior to flightSpaceX is responsible for transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. \n",
      "The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011,[160][161]followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of itsDragon 2spacecraft.[162]In September 2014 NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS.[163]SpaceX won US$2.6 billion to complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts include at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon achieves NASA certification, the contract requires SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[163]SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, aPad Abort Test, in May 2015.[164]In early 2017 SpaceX was awarded four additional crewed missions to the ISS from NASA.[165]In early 2019 SpaceX successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight of Crew Dragon, which docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[166]In January 2020, SpaceX conducted anin-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario.[167]On 30 May 2020 theCrew Dragon Demo-2mission was launched to theInternational Space Stationwith NASA astronautsBob BehnkenandDoug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first commercial crewed launch to theISS.[168]TheCrew-1mission was successfully launched to theInternational Space Stationon 16 November 2020, withNASAastronautsMichael Hopkins,Victor GloverandShannon Walkeralong withJAXAastronautSoichi Noguchi,[169]all members of theExpedition 64crew.[170]National defense[edit]Launch of the STP-2 mission in June 2019In 2005 SpaceX announced that it had been awarded anIndefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) contract, allowing theUnited States Air Forceto purchase up to US$100 million worth of launches from the company.[171]In April 2008,NASAannounced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to US$1 billion, depending on the number of missions awarded. The contract covers launch services ordered by June 2010, for launches through December 2012.[172]Musk stated in the same 2008 announcement that SpaceX has sold 14 contracts for flights on the variousFalconvehicles.[172]In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with theUnited States Department of Defense(DoD). The United States Air ForceSpace and Missile Systems Centerawarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions:Deep Space Climate Observatory(DSCOVR) andSpace Test Program 2(STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on aFalcon 9launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on aFalcon Heavyon 25 June 2019.[173]In May 2015 the United States Air Force announced that theFalcon 9 v1.1was certified forNational Security Space Launch(NSSL), which allows SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[174]This broke the monopoly held since 2006 byUnited Launch Alliance(ULA) over the U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads.[175]In April 2016 the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the 2ndGPS 3satellite for US$82.7 million.[176]This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[177]SpaceX also launched the 3rd GPS 3 launch on 20 June 2020.[178]In March 2018 SpaceX secured an additional US$290 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[179]In 2016 the U.S.National Reconnaissance Office(NRO) purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on 1 May 2017.[180]In February 2019, SpaceX secured a US$297 million contract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.[181]On 7 August 2020 theU.S. Space Forceawarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for US$316 million for one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. militaries satellite launch requirements over the period.[182]Space tourism[edit]In February 2020Space Adventuresannounced plans to fly private citizens into orbit on Crew Dragon in late 2021 or 2022. The company would launch a Crew Dragon with up to four paying tourists on board, and spend up to five days in alow Earth orbitabove the orbit of theInternational Space Station.[183]Launch market competition and pricing pressure[edit]Main article:Space launch market competitionSpaceX's low launch prices, especially forcommunication satellitesflying togeostationary transfer orbit(GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[8]Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated byArianespace(flying theAriane 5) andInternational Launch Services(flying theProton).[184]With a published price of US$56.5 million per launch tolow Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the cheapest in the industry.[185]European satellite operators are pushing theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) to reduce launch prices of theAriane 5and the futureAriane 6rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX.[186]In 2014 no commercial launches were booked to fly on the RussianProtonrocket.[35]SpaceX also put an end to theUnited Launch Alliance(ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.[187]To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce in order to decrease launch costs by half.[188][189]Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASASpace Act Agreementprocess of \"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry\" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA's own independently verified numbers, SpaceX's total development cost for both the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets was estimated at approximately US$390 million. In 2011 NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about US$4 billion to develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA's traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[152]In May 2020 NASA's administratorJim Bridenstineremarked that thanks to NASA's investments into SpaceX the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country.[190]Board of directors[edit]SpaceXboard of directorsas of January 2021[191]Joined BoardNameTitles2002[192]Elon MuskFounder, Chairman, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; CEO,Product Architect, and former Chairman ofTesla; former Chairman ofSolarCity[192]2002[193]Kimbal MuskBoard member, Tesla[194]2009[195]Gwynne ShotwellPresident and COO of SpaceX[196]2009[195]Luke NosekCo-founder, PayPal[197]2009[195]Steve JurvetsonCo-founder, Future Ventures fund[198]2010[199]Antonio GraciasCEO and Chairman of the Investment Committee at Valor Equity Partners[200]2015[201]Donald HarrisonPresident of global partnerships and corporate development, Google[202]See also[edit]Blue OriginHuman mission to MarsList of crewed spacecraftPrivate spaceflightSpace colonizationSpaceX Mars programReferences[edit]^\"California Business Search (C2414622 - Space Exploration Technologies Corp)\".
